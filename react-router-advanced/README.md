## 📝 Task 2 – Advanced Routing in React with React Router

**Objective:**  
Implement nested, protected, and dynamic routes using React Router.

**Implementation:**  
- Code is in `src/App.jsx` and `src/components/`.  
- Nested routes: `ProfileDetails` and `ProfileSettings` inside `Profile`.  
- Protected route: `/profile` requires authentication.  
- Dynamic route: `/blog/:id` renders posts based on URL parameter.

**How to Run:**  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
