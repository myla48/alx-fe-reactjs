## 🔑 Tips for Task 0
- Keep the README **simple but complete** — it’s the first impression of your repo.  
- Use **Markdown formatting** (headers, lists, code blocks) for readability.  
- Include **setup instructions** so anyone can run your project.  
- Add a **short description of learning objectives** (ALX loves this part).

👉 Would you like me to **draft a polished README specifically for your “GitHub User Search” project** (with React + API context), so you can copy-paste it into your repo?
